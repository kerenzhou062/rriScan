# rriScan
Here, we describe the RNA-Binding Site Seeker (rriScan), An universal software for analyzing RNA-RNA interactome sequencing data, such as `MARIO`, `PARIS`, `PARIS2` and `LIGR-seq` data.

# Installation
* It's very easy to install rriScan on a linux server with following commands:
    ```bash
    # suppose your path to install software is /username/software
    
    cd /username/software
    
    git clone https://github.com/kerenzhou062/rriScan.git
    
    cd ./rriScan
    
    sh install.sh
    
    export PATH=$PATH:/username/software/rriScan/bin
    ```

# Input
* A genome sequences in fasta format is required by `--fa` argument, which chromsome's name must be the same with input `bam` file.

* An fai index file is required by `--fai` argument, which can be generated by using `samtools`:

    ```bash
    # suppose your input genome fasta file is hg38.fa
    
    samtools faidx hg38.fa
    ```

* A `bam` file contains sequence alignment data is required by `--bam` argument, which can be generated by `STAR` software.

* A `juction` file contains high confidence collapsed splice junctions in tab-delimited format, which can be generated by `STAR` software ans stored as `SJ.out.tab` file.

* A `fastq` or `fasta` file contains sequencing reads is optional.

# Output
Here's the description of columns in the outputs:

| Column name      | Description
| -----------      |----------
| `chrom`          | chromosome name


# Basic Usage
The available options of rriScan are as follow:

```shell
Usage:  rriScan [options] --fa <fasta file> --fai <fai file> --bam <mapped alignments> --jun <junctions>
File format for mapped alignments is BAM
[options]

-S/--small                     : small genome
--fa                           : genome FASTA file. [required]
--fai                          : genome fai file, an index file for fasta file. [required]
--bam                          : alignment file, BAM format. [required]
--jun                          : junction file from STAR software, junction format. [required]
--read                         : read file[fastq or fasta]. [optional]
-o/--output <string>           : output file
